# HTML Basics Practice

This repository contains my practice files as I learn HTML and get hands-on experience with Git and GitHub.

## What Iâ€™ll be doing:
- Creating and editing HTML files
- Practicing basic HTML tags and structure
- Learning how to use Git: commits, branches, pushing to GitHub
- Tracking my progress step by step
